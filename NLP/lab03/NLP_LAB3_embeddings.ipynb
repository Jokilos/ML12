I was expecting more upscale hotel common areas,\\u003cbr\\u003elounges and casino floors. We even had an updated room in the Palace tower, but\\u003cbr\\u003eit still didn't make up for the less than appealing casino and tacky common\\u003cbr\\u003eareas.  I was also expecting a customer service oriented hotel\\u002fcasino staff that\\u003cbr\\u003emost people would expect from any hotel in the US.   We really enjoyed visiting\\u003cbr\\u003eand gambling at the Bellagio, Wynn\\u002fEncore, and Planet Hollywood (all of which\\u003cbr\\u003ehad much cheaper rooms when I had booked CP).  The Bellagio and Wynn\\u002fEncore felt\\u003cbr\\u003eand looked (and smelled) 4-5 stars and that is what I had in mind when I booked\\u003cbr\\u003eCaesars. In my opinion, Caesars Palace is a 3 star hotel if you stay in the\\u003cbr\\u003enewer towers.  2 star for the Roman tower rooms.   The poor guest service,\\u003cbr\\u003eoutdated 80s lack luster casino areas, and thick throat constricting stench of\\u003cbr\\u003ethe place really brings Caesars Palace down. Sure the marble and statues are\\u003cbr\\u003enice and some areas are nicer than others, but Caesars Palace as a whole is\\u003cbr\\u003edisappointing.  The place reeks of cigar smoke and an airfreshner that is a mix\\u003cbr\\u003eof kitty litter and sunless tanning spray.  The sports book is lacking in a huge\\u003cbr\\u003eway.  If the prices for Caesars were more around $169 or less than it would be a\\u003cbr\\u003ereasonable place to stay.\\\\n\\\\nWe paid $330 a night to stay at Caesars and for\\u003cbr\\u003ethat price we could have booked the Bellagio and received true Vegas luxury\\u003cbr\\u003ethroughout the hotel and casino.    Our room was not comped or discounted.   Our\\u003cbr\\u003etrip was pre-paid and set up through a travel agent.    We were there Nov.4-\\u003cbr\\u003eNov.7, 2010.    \\\\n\\\\nCheck-In was horrible.  As seeing how they have over 3300\\u003cbr\\u003erooms, Caesars Palace should be experienced with how to check-in guests\\u003cbr\\u003eefficiently even during the busiest times...that is their job as a hotel.  There\\u003cbr\\u003eshould be no excuse for how we were treated like second class citizens upon\\u003cbr\\u003echeck-in.   I was very patient, polite and kind to the check-in staff during my\\u003cbr\\u003edealings with them.   We waited over 7 hours to check-in.   I called to talk\\u003cbr\\u003ewith a manager after our return home to let the hotel know about our check-in\\u003cbr\\u003eexperience, and the supervisor I talked with could care less.  Apparently,\\u003cbr\\u003ehaving to wait hours for a room is par for the course during busy times and the\\u003cbr\\u003ehotel doesn't care.  The supervisor chalked it up to being busy and that they\\u003cbr\\u003ehave to deal with travelers all of the time (Hello... what hotel doesn't have to\\u003cbr\\u003edeal with travelers??)  It seems like the hotel staff and bar staff and casino\\u003cbr\\u003estaff assumes that everyone is comped and getting a free room because they are\\u003cbr\\u003ethe most uncaring and apathetic lot of staff I have ever dealt with at a hotel.\\u003cbr\\u003e\\\\n\\\\nOur palace tower room was nice, but outdated some.

All over the place are plush areas to\\u003cbr\\u003esit down with a ton of TVs to watch everything all over the place. In the main\\u003cbr\\u003earea there is a huge screen (like someone mentioned 40' x 20' screen) with\\u003cbr\\u003estadium seating. All around the back there other nicely furnished rooms with\\u003cbr\\u003emore big screen TVs and the like.\\\\n\\\\nThe other good thing about this place was\\u003cbr\\u003eour service. On both occasions our servers were very attentive and always\\u003cbr\\u003echecked on us and asked if we needed anything. Even the backup servers helped us\\u003cbr\\u003eout whenever we needed anything as well.\\\\n\\\\nNEGATIVE\\\\nOn our first occasion here\\u003cbr\\u003ewe were led on a little tour and then seated in the \\\\\\\"Sapphire Room\\\\\\\" towards\\u003cbr\\u003ethe back of the place. Like I said earlier it was nicely furnished and there was\\u003cbr\\u003ea pool table in there. We were sitting in there having a good time for about\\u003cbr\\u003etwenty minutes and had gotten our first round of drinks when our waitress asked\\u003cbr\\u003eus if we knew that it was a $40 spending minimum PER PERSON for us to sit in\\u003cbr\\u003ethat particular room! No one had mentioned this when we were first seated so we\\u003cbr\\u003ewere pretty taken aback when we heard this. As we only wanted to have a few\\u003cbr\\u003edrinks and watch basketball we decided to take ourselves out of this section to\\u003cbr\\u003ean area where there was no preset spending limit. Granted I know you need to\\u003cbr\\u003espend some kind of money when you're watching sports in bars, but this was\\u003cbr\\u003eabsurdly high.\\\\n\\\\nThe food we had here, while it wasn't bad, it was pretty\\u003cbr\\u003emediocre.\\\\n-On our first trip here we had the cheese fries. The fries were only\\u003cbr\\u003eOK, but what really set this appetizer back was the fact that they dumped like\\u003cbr\\u003echeese whiz cheese on it or that rubbery cheese you get with your nachos from\\u003cbr\\u003e7-11. How hard is it to get shredded cheddar and micro or heat it so that it\\u003cbr\\u003emelts on the fries?\\\\n-The second meal I had at this place were their \\\\\\\"40\\u002f40\\u003cbr\\u003eburgers\\\\\\\" which essentially is their version of sliders. Nothing to write home\\u003cbr\\u003eabout either. I asked for them to be done medium and they were pretty charred\\u003cbr\\u003ewhen I got them. Twelve dollars for three little burgers that were overcooked?\\u003cbr\\u003eOnce again, just OK.\\\\n-Some of the other meals that I saw but didn't try were\\u003cbr\\u003etheir pizzas. It looked like something that came from the freezer section at the\\u003cbr\\u003esupermarket, like Aunty Celeste's pizzas or something. They didn't look that\\u003cbr\\u003eappetizing and no one really said much about them so I assume they weren't that\\u003cbr\\u003egreat either.\\\\n-Drinks were kinda pricey too.\\\\n\\\\nNow for the really bad part of\\u003cbr\\u003eour whole experience. We had a group of eight of us when we came and one of our\\u003cbr\\u003ebuddies who set the thing up had called in to make reservations for us to having\\u003cbr\\u003eprime seating in this place. When we get their this big bouncer tells us that\\u003cbr\\u003emaking reservations \\\\\\\"doesn't really mean anything.\\\\\\\" That's all well and good I\\u003cbr\\u003eguess, now if they only took all that stuff about making reservations off their\\u003cbr\\u003ewebsite then.\\\\n\\\\nSo the next thing he tells us is that \\\\\\\"if you take care of me,\\u003cbr\\u003eI'll take care of you.\\\\\\\"  And so my friend who set up the whole thing was like\\u003cbr\\u003eOK, fine, so he shelled out $60 for us to get prime seating. What does our\\u003cbr\\u003ebouncer guy do, he goes into the prime seating area and kicks out a few guys\\u003cbr\\u003ethat are sitting in there  so that we can sit down. After we get in there we\\u003cbr\\u003efind out that there's not enough space for our group to sit down, so we have to\\u003cbr\\u003etalk to our \\\\\\\"friend\\\\\\\" one more time to find us a space that we all can fit in.\\u003cbr\\u003eLuckily he found us an open corner where we could all sit, but unfortunately two\\u003cbr\\u003eof us didn't have ANY view of a television set whatsoever.\\\\n\\\\nAfter this whole\\u003cbr\\u003eseating thing, we were kinda rubbed the wrong way. At the end of the night we\\u003cbr\\u003ewanted to talk to the manager about what had happened and finally after about\\u003cbr\\u003etwenty minutes of talking to people we finally got the attention of the manager\\u003cbr\\u003e(who really didn't look or feel like a manager from the way she was dressed).\\u003cbr\\u003eEssentially she told us to come back tomorrow as they have to review tapes and\\u003cbr\\u003etalk to people to find out exactly what happened. Seeing as how we were headed\\u003cbr\\u003esomewhere else already we said we would come back the next day to hopefully\\u003cbr\\u003eresolve everything.\\\\n\\\\nI was less than confident that things would be resolved\\u003cbr\\u003ethe next day, but when we went back to 40\\u002f40 the next day we went in and the\\u003cbr\\u003ebouncer guy that took our money came up to us, said the manager wanted him to\\u003cbr\\u003etalk to us and apologize for what happened last night and he even gave us our\\u003cbr\\u003emoney back. While it was great that he did this it didn't seem too sincere and I\\u003cbr\\u003ewas actually surprised that the manager didn't come out to talk to us to make\\u003cbr\\u003esure this whole thing was resolved.\\\\n\\\\nIn the end we'll probably not go to this\\u003cbr\\u003eplace again.

It used to be packed with kids ditching\\u003cbr\\u003eschool, anchored by a fuckin' Sears and you even used to be able to smoke\\u003cbr\\u003einside.

There\\u003cbr\\u003ewere  four food trucks at the rally: Herban Legend, a cupcake truck, Goody\\u003cbr\\u003eWoody's (tacos, burritos), and Sticks and Cones (ice cream).  I was told Herban\\u003cbr\\u003eLegend is currently one of Charlotte's most popular food trucks, so I went with\\u003cbr\\u003ethem.\\\\n\\\\nThis truck serves sandwiches, wraps, burgers, and hot dogs.  Most items\\u003cbr\\u003eare in the $6-8 range.  Sides run up to $5 each and non-alcoholic beverages are\\u003cbr\\u003e$1 each.  No combos.  Everything's ordered a la carte.  There's a bit of\\u003cbr\\u003ediversity on the menu -- you can get a French dip, like one of my buddies got, a\\u003cbr\\u003eCuban sandwich, tostada, curry chicken wrap, and fish and chips.\\\\n\\\\nI went with\\u003cbr\\u003ethe shawarma, which is an Arab wrap, for $6.50.  This is one of the truck's top\\u003cbr\\u003esellers.  I've had my fair share of shawarmas and thought Herban Legend's\\u003cbr\\u003eversion was OK.  Theirs includes grilled chicken, Greek tzatziki sauce, tabouleh\\u003cbr\\u003esalad (cold minty salad made with bulgur and parsley), chopped tomatoes and\\u003cbr\\u003efrench fries wrapped in flat bread.\\\\n\\\\nThe flat bread was grilled so it was hard\\u003cbr\\u003eand brittle.  This caused the wrap to break apart easily once I grabbed the\\u003cbr\\u003esucker to bite into it.  It was packed with a sufficient amount of ingredients\\u003cbr\\u003eand plenty of sauce, so much so that the sauce was spilling all over the place\\u003cbr\\u003eas I ate.  Overall, it was satisfying, though I'd probably prefer softer bread\\u003cbr\\u003eand it'd be cool if they had some meat options like other shawarma joints\\u003cbr\\u003eoffer.\\\\n\\\\nI also ordered a side of Herban's truffle fries, which at $5, is\\u003cbr\\u003epretty expensive for a side of fries.

One order of fries is good for 2-3\\u003cbr\\u003epeople.\\\\n\\\\nIf I ever get the chance to revisit this truck, I'll probably order\\u003cbr\\u003ethe fried green tomato grilled cheese sandwich.

I purchased 5 Hybrid-T 36\\\\\\\" Rose Trees that were listed as\\u003cbr\\u003e\\\\\\\"Firefighter\\\\\\\" as the color.  There were a couple that did not have flowers on\\u003cbr\\u003ethem so there was no way of verifying the color.  Berridge offers a 90 day\\u003cbr\\u003ewarranty on these plants, so I wasn't too worried. \\\\n\\\\nAfter planting them and a\\u003cbr\\u003eweek later, sure enough one of them was white, and not the red that my fiance so\\u003cbr\\u003edearly wanted.

The menu describes it as \\\\\\\"sweet mustard cole slaw\\\\\\\" but\\u003cbr\\u003eit was basically wet cabbage. My chicken sandwich, while nice and hot, was also\\u003cbr\\u003epretty bland. The sweet potato chip breading didn't have as much flavor as I'd\\u003cbr\\u003eanticipated, and they really skimped on the chipotle mayo.

Also, other\\u003cbr\\u003ereviewers mentioned that they received complimentary chocolate chip cookies. We\\u003cbr\\u003edidn't get any, so either they no longer do this, or they were forgotten since\\u003cbr\\u003ewe had to flag down our waitress just to pay the bill so we could get to our\\u003cbr\\u003eshow on time.

The quick and dirty review - food was exceptional, service was\\u003cbr\\u003emediocre and the environment was uncomfortably warm and lackluster (though not\\u003cbr\\u003eterrible).  As my appetizer I ordered the baked eggplant - and wow - I almost\\u003cbr\\u003ewish I could have ordered it for dinner.  It was a generous portion stuffed with\\u003cbr\\u003efresh mozzarella and a light tomato sauce.  I honestly thought nothing would\\u003cbr\\u003eoutshine this starter but the sea bass was a flaky, tender and flavorful\\u003cbr\\u003edelight.  It was topped with thinly sliced vegetables and sat on a bed of potato\\u003cbr\\u003egratin topped with a most delicious lobster sauce.  For dessert I tried to be\\u003cbr\\u003e\\\\\\\"good\\\\\\\" and ordered the mango-berry sorbet.  I did indeed get sorbet. And it\\u003cbr\\u003edid indeed taste like mango-berry.  Not much more I can say on that.  \\\\n\\\\nAs for\\u003cbr\\u003ethe service, our waiter was very sweet but the timing of our experience was not\\u003cbr\\u003every good.  Our reservation was for 8 PM and we didn't leave the restaurant\\u003cbr\\u003euntil nearly 10 PM.  We also sat with finished entree plates for a notable\\u003cbr\\u003elength of time.  \\\\n\\\\nPerhaps my biggest complaint was the temperature.  If you\\u003cbr\\u003ehave not been to Caffe Siena before, the kitchen is viewable from the\\u003cbr\\u003erestaurant.  It's a large cut-out in the wall and the prepared food is actually\\u003cbr\\u003eplaced on a visible counter for the servers to pick up.  Now anytime you decide\\u003cbr\\u003eto combine the kitchen and the dining room it's super important that the heat\\u003cbr\\u003ecoming off the kitchen is tempered by a solid A\\u002fC system.  I'm not sure what was\\u003cbr\\u003egoing on but the front door of the restaurant was propped open, the ovens were\\u003cbr\\u003egoing full force and by the end of dinner some of us were sweating. The smell\\u003cbr\\u003ethat came out of the kitchen also permeated into the dining room so it smelled\\u003cbr\\u003elike I was standing over the frying pan for most of the night.

It\\u003cbr\\u003ewasn't even 4PM yet.  He looks at the clock and asks if I was leaving the car\\u003cbr\\u003eovernight.  REALLY?  For a tire?  I told him no, and he could take it up with\\u003cbr\\u003ehis mgr if he had an issue.  Finally after all was said and done, about an hour\\u003cbr\\u003elater he tells my wife and I he can't fix it and we need a new tire.  There was\\u003cbr\\u003ea nail to close to the side wall.  So my wife asked why didn't they catch it the\\u003cbr\\u003efirst time when the tires were rotated and the Low Tire Pressure issue was\\u003cbr\\u003eaddressed......He got all defensive, and goes back and forth with my wife on\\u003cbr\\u003e\\\\\\\"PROCEDURE\\\\\\\".  I laughed in his face, took the keys and he storms away with his\\u003cbr\\u003e'great customer care skills'.  Why get upset with us?  Because we asked the\\u003cbr\\u003eright questions?

They listed about a dozen of them on their website.\\\\n\\\\nThe girl at\\u003cbr\\u003ethe front looked like she was about to leap the counter and chase me down,\\u003cbr\\u003ebecause we headed into the warehouse and I didn't hear her go \\\\\\\"Ma'am?

It really wasn't worth the drive for us to save that... If you live 10\\u003cbr\\u003eminutes away, sure. \\\\n\\\\nThere were a ton of business-dressed shoppers who seemed\\u003cbr\\u003emiffed at my dog being with us (ew, dog hair in the air!), and at one point we\\u003cbr\\u003ewere down an aisle and turned to see about 5 shoppers and employees all standing\\u003cbr\\u003eat the entrance, staring at us. I felt like I was in Children of the Corn, when\\u003cbr\\u003ethe girl turns to see all the kids murderously watching her.... It was super\\u003cbr\\u003ecreepy.\\\\n\\\\n80% of the stock was stuffed toys and dog clothing. My dog's\\u003cbr\\u003emouthiness and chewing power would make a great white shark jealous, and he\\u003cbr\\u003eneeds tough toys... A stuffed skunk ain't gonna cut it.

Since it was open I have to say it\\u003cbr\\u003ehas become one of my favourite student union bars.\\\\n\\\\nSpread over two levels,\\u003cbr\\u003ewith a spiral staircase connecting the two, the Library Bar has a rustic, old\\u003cbr\\u003elibrary look with a slightly more modern looking bar.

Let's do this review in a pros & cons style based on 2 years of giving them\\u003cbr\\u003eour business. \\\\n\\\\nPros: \\\\nEasy interstate access off I-515 or as some call it\\u003cbr\\u003ethe 95. \\\\nAmple parking. \\\\nNice building on the outside. \\\\nDark but nice on the\\u003cbr\\u003einside. \\\\nPlenty of HDTV's around the bar and strategically placed so you can\\u003cbr\\u003ewatch pretty much anything that's on at the time. \\\\nSeparate, glassed off non-\\u003cbr\\u003esmoking area if you want to eat without the smoke. \\\\nDrinks: strong pours by\\u003cbr\\u003eknowledgeable bartenders who know their stuff. \\\\nFood: from fish & chips to\\u003cbr\\u003enachos they have a pretty nice range of offerings with something for almost\\u003cbr\\u003eeveryone. And their sliders have been real kid pleasers around here. \\\\nTHEY\\u003cbr\\u003eOFFER TAKEOUT WITHOUT ATTITUDE. Just walk in, go to the back of the bar and find\\u003cbr\\u003ea bartender and you'll have nicely wrapped bags of food in no time. \\\\nOh and if\\u003cbr\\u003ethey say 15 minutes, they mean 15. I like their consistency. \\\\n\\\\nCons: \\\\nService\\u003cbr\\u003ecan sometimes be slow. Sometimes...but it's rare. \\\\nFood: I've had the\\u003cbr\\u003eoccasional problem like soggy sweet potato fries, or cold onion rings, and I've\\u003cbr\\u003ehad maybe 2 orders out of 50+ that had issues where I sent it back or\\u003cbr\\u003ecomplained. Again, 2 out of 50+. \\\\nI did find a strand of hair on my sweet\\u003cbr\\u003epotato fries once. \\\\nOn a bright day adjusting to how dark the place is can be a\\u003cbr\\u003elittle rough. But it's a bar, so I really shouldn't say anything about it but I\\u003cbr\\u003edid anyway. \\\\n\\\\nAgain, I'm looking back over 2 years plus now as I write this\\u003cbr\\u003eand my family keeps asking for their food, and we keep going back. \\\\n\\\\n4 Stars.\\u003cbr\\u003eYMMV but for us Remedy's will be staying on our fail-safe food options list.\"],[\"The name itself sounds rebellious, so I had huge expectations of rowdiness when\\u003cbr\\u003eI came here but was pleasantly surprised at how classy and friendly the staff\\u003cbr\\u003ewas.  \\\\n\\\\nCulinary Dropout was our first stop in Vegas when we arrived.  We were\\u003cbr\\u003ehungry, thirsty and needed to start partying after our flight from Orange\\u003cbr\\u003eCounty.

I can see it working for a party with friends, or a\\u003cbr\\u003eromantic date.  \\\\n\\\\nWe decided to order apps instead of meals so we have a\\u003cbr\\u003elittle more room for alcohol (ha!).  We ordered the artichoke hearts, pretzel\\u003cbr\\u003efondue (that everyone on Yelp is raving about), and a charcuterie of Iberico ham\\u003cbr\\u003eand manchego cheese.\\\\n\\\\nArtichoke hearts:  tender, with a slightly smoke flavor.\\u003cbr\\u003eIt had this cheesy cream that went well with it, topped with baby spinach.  They\\u003cbr\\u003ealso drizzled it with an orange marmalade which I personally didn't care for.  I\\u003cbr\\u003elike orange marmalade on toast, but not on my artichoke hearts.  \\\\n\\\\nPretzel\\u003cbr\\u003efondue:  Everyone was raving about this here on Yelp.  I found it too salty for\\u003cbr\\u003emy liking.  There was almost too much salt on the pretzels and the fondue\\u003cbr\\u003e(served in a cute little pot and tealight warmer) had a slightly gritty texture,\\u003cbr\\u003eand that was salty too, reminded me of Cheez Whiz out of a jar.  Maybe they made\\u003cbr\\u003eit salty on purpose because we were pounding beer after beer to wash it\\u003cbr\\u003edown.\\\\n\\\\nNow for the BEST part of our meal, the Iberico ham: O.M.EFFING.G. Talk\\u003cbr\\u003eabout melt in your mouth awesome goodness.  It was like butter, no gaminess,\\u003cbr\\u003ewith a slightly sweet note in the back.  It went well with the slightly salty\\u003cbr\\u003ebitterness of the manchego cheese.  They served it with a cherry compote on the\\u003cbr\\u003eside and two pieces of crostini bread and made a fancy little ham and cheese\\u003cbr\\u003esandwich.  Mind you, they gave us maybe half a cup of thin ham shavings at MP\\u003cbr\\u003e$19.\\\\n\\\\nBottom line, would I come back here?  Probably not.\\\\n\\\\nWith all the\\u003cbr\\u003evarious and unique dining experiences Vegas has to offer, I don't think Culinary\\u003cbr\\u003eDropout is memorable enough for me to take time out of my precious vacation to\\u003cbr\\u003eventure back here.

They installed\\u003cbr\\u003ea new computer system days before we arrived and many staff didn't know how to\\u003cbr\\u003euse it properly. One day people got stuck in the elevator for over an hour. My\\u003cbr\\u003eroom wasn't cleaned 2 of the 5 days I was there. When I called housekeeping to\\u003cbr\\u003ecomplain, they either didn't answer the phone or promised to get it done. After\\u003cbr\\u003ethree attempts I gave up.   My clock didn't work in the room, lamp didn't have a\\u003cbr\\u003elightbulb, and the iron was broken.

My dad is a huge fan\\u003cbr\\u003eof celebrity chefs, being the devotee of Food Network that he is.  Bouchon\\u003cbr\\u003eshould impress him, given the whole \\\\\\\"French Laundry is the best restaurant in\\u003cbr\\u003ethe United States\\\\\\\" thing with Thomas Keller.  And while Bouchon isn't French\\u003cbr\\u003eLaundry, I think that the meal was good enough to impress.\\\\n\\\\nWe were seated\\u003cbr\\u003epromptly, though we were late for our reservation by about ten minutes.  We\\u003cbr\\u003eblame this on the fact that Bouchon is a hard restaurant to find.  A security\\u003cbr\\u003eguard had to guide us through the Venetian Canal shops, down an escalator, to\\u003cbr\\u003ethe right elevators.  Bouchon is located way up on the 20th floor (I think),\\u003cbr\\u003ewhich seemed like an odd place to have a restaurant.  However, it ended up being\\u003cbr\\u003ea perfect location, since we didn't have a huge crowd , flashing slot machine\\u003cbr\\u003elights, or the sounds of bells\\u002fwhistles right outside the door.\\\\n\\\\nThe space at\\u003cbr\\u003eBouchon is nice, with high ceilings and large windows that allow for plenty of\\u003cbr\\u003enatural light.  The tables are covered in butcher paper and the menu is actually\\u003cbr\\u003ethe paper around the napkin.  The fresh baguette was warm and delicious,\\u003cbr\\u003eespecially with the butter, which was really flavorful.  \\\\n\\\\nI was disappointed\\u003cbr\\u003ethat they no longer had the frisee salad with poached egg and bacon on the menu\\u003cbr\\u003eand the waiter explained that they change their menu about four times a year.\\u003cbr\\u003eRats!  They had just had the change and I wasn't really feeling the other salads\\u003cbr\\u003eon the menu.  Instead, we opted to share the salmon rillettes with extra\\u003cbr\\u003ecroutons, which was amazing.  I could have just brought a jar of that and their\\u003cbr\\u003efresh baguettes back with me to Wynn and had an awesome midnight snack lounging\\u003cbr\\u003ein the tub and watching TV.  The rillettes are also served with a bowl of their\\u003cbr\\u003emarinated olives, which were good (the green olives in particular).\\\\n\\\\nFor the\\u003cbr\\u003eentrees, we ended up getting the trout, the steak frites, the salmon, and the\\u003cbr\\u003eveal breast.  ALL of these entrees were delicious.  The trout, which was what I\\u003cbr\\u003eordered, was perfectly cooked in a brown butter sauce, with a mound of the most\\u003cbr\\u003edelicious haricot verts and slivered almonds.  The salmon was also done just\\u003cbr\\u003eright and came beautifully presented in a copper pan.  The veal was good, though\\u003cbr\\u003ea little bit stringy and tough.  The steak was also delicious, though the VAST\\u003cbr\\u003epile of frites was a bit overwhelming.  Though the fries were seasoned just\\u003cbr\\u003eright and crisp when they first come out, atfer cooling, they did turn a bit\\u003cbr\\u003elimp.  Even being ardent fries fans, we could not finish them.  The entree\\u003cbr\\u003eportions are huge, so much to the point that we did not have room for dessert.\\u003cbr\\u003eThat was disappointing, since the profiteroles being enjoyed the next table over\\u003cbr\\u003eseemed divine.    \\\\n\\\\nOverall, a great place for delicious bistro food in a\\u003cbr\\u003erelaxed setting.

They have two stations, one for sushi prep, and\\u003cbr\\u003eanother for hot foods, yet all the seated patrons were receiving food one dish\\u003cbr\\u003eat a time at an excruciatingly slow pace. When our host finally seated us after\\u003cbr\\u003ewe had awkwardly stood there (waiting to be seated) for ten minutes, once we sat\\u003cbr\\u003edown, after another ten minutes, the host brought us waters in what could be the\\u003cbr\\u003efilthiest glasses on record.

One server\\u003cbr\\u003ecame to the table next to us to fill up waters, but clearly couldn't be bothered\\u003cbr\\u003eto attend to our table (even though the place is pretty small). My normal policy\\u003cbr\\u003eis to wait at least ten minutes before getting someone's attention, and by this\\u003cbr\\u003epoint, we had already been there over half an hour, without any service\\u003cbr\\u003ewhatsoever.

I ordered the Veal, which\\u003cbr\\u003ewas good and my grand mother had the same thing, she liked it as well. My wife,\\u003cbr\\u003ebrother and mother ordered the crab stuffed chicken. My wife said it was \\\\\\\"OK\\\\\\\"\\u003cbr\\u003eand was a little dry. We had a couple starters, the fried zucchini and mushroom\\u003cbr\\u003ecaps. They were both very good. The prices were reasonable $15-$19 per dish, and\\u003cbr\\u003ethe portions were good. \\\\n\\\\n(2) Atmosphere: From what I understand, this is a\\u003cbr\\u003enewer restaurant, but to be honest, it looked like something that hadn't been\\u003cbr\\u003eupdated since 1979. The furniture looked user, the carpet was dirty and it just\\u003cbr\\u003ereminded me of places we went when I was a kid in the 1970-80's. Very dark. It\\u003cbr\\u003ehas a nice location on the hill, they should work on their interior and get some\\u003cbr\\u003emodern furniture.

I did not think they were super busy as there were empty tables,\\u003cbr\\u003eso they cannot use them being busy as to why they were slow.

Daniel Bouluds (of\\u003cbr\\u003eCafe Boulud Fame in NYC) new high-end restaurant has been opened for nearly\\u003cbr\\u003ethree weeks and has started to create a buzz. While the lunch and dinner menus\\u003cbr\\u003elook fantastic, it was the brunch menu that piqued our interest. There are only\\u003cbr\\u003ea few options available on the high-end brunch (Renoir, Cafe Birks), so this was\\u003cbr\\u003ea welcome addition.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, before getting to the food, lets discuss the\\u003cbr\\u003erestaurant itself. The space is quite large, but with relatively few tables and\\u003cbr\\u003efeels both busy and intimate at the same time. Expertly decorated, the\\u003cbr\\u003ecentrepiece is the open kitchen, where Chef Boulud could be seen working the\\u003cbr\\u003epans on a recent Sunday morning. Despite the renovations, the hotel decided to\\u003cbr\\u003ekeep the inner garden, and the restaurant has a beautiful terrace overlooking\\u003cbr\\u003ethe duck pond. \\\\n\\\\nNow on to the food! The brunch menu consists of entrees and\\u003cbr\\u003emain courses, available a la carte or in a prix fixe style. Though more\\u003cbr\\u003eexpensive than your regular scrambled eggs and bacon (36$) the meal comes\\u003cbr\\u003etogether quite well. Numerous salty and sweet options are available. \\\\n\\\\nFor the\\u003cbr\\u003emain course, everything from french toast to home made gnocchi to the classic\\u003cbr\\u003ehangover beater steak and eggs are available. We opted for two classic dishes,\\u003cbr\\u003ethe gravlax with latkes and the croque madame. While far from extravagant, the\\u003cbr\\u003eattention to detail raise these two dishes from regular brunch to four star\\u003cbr\\u003elevel. Not to be overlooked are the fries accompanying the croque madame which\\u003cbr\\u003emay be some of the best in the city.\\\\n\\\\nOur waiter seem to have no idea how to\\u003cbr\\u003ehandle his completely packed section. Luckily, after long waits between\\u003cbr\\u003earriving, receiving coffee and ordering, the very nice Maitre D' stepped in and\\u003cbr\\u003etook care of our service.\\\\n\\\\nFinal Verdict : We will be back, if only to spend a\\u003cbr\\u003enight on that beautiful terrace.\"],[\"Hamburgers and Onion Rings - the bomb.

You could go anywhere you want, the public transportation\\u003cbr\\u003eis very very good.  It's also walkable distance to Old Montreal, it's a bit far\\u003cbr\\u003ebut not too bad either.

My issues lie with this last document.\\\\n\\\\nThe\\u003cbr\\u003etravel guidelines, state that if travel is required for retrieval (which usually\\u003cbr\\u003eis) \\\\\\\"TWEB will have a companion who will be designated by TWEB share your hotel\\u003cbr\\u003eroom with you.  You will have separate beds.  Family and friends cannot be\\u003cbr\\u003ecompanions.  If they wish to accompany the donor, it will be at their cost with\\u003cbr\\u003ea separate hotel room.\\\\\\\"  This is absolutely absurd.  In past experience, EVERY\\u003cbr\\u003eOTHER agency that I have dealt with allows for a family member or friend of the\\u003cbr\\u003edonor to accompany the donor with all of their travel expenses paid for.  How do\\u003cbr\\u003ethey expect a donor to feel comfortable sleeping in the same hotel room with\\u003cbr\\u003esome random stranger in a strange city (or foreign country).  This shows that\\u003cbr\\u003ethey have absolutely no consideration or concern for the donor and raises a HUGE\\u003cbr\\u003ered flag.

I figure O.K. you cant really screw this\\u003cbr\\u003eup.\\\\n\\\\nThe Peroni comes out first (Peroni is like the Italian Budweiser...Its at\\u003cbr\\u003ethe most about 13 bucks for a 12 pack at the corner store.)

On the bright side though it made my hand\\u003cbr\\u003elook gigantic in the pictures we took.\\\\n\\\\nThe grilled \\\\\\\"garden vegetable\\\\\\\" pizza\\u003cbr\\u003ecame out next...Since I knew I was getting bent over anyway for eating at the\\u003cbr\\u003eBellagio I wasn't expecting too much. At least it met my expectations. The\\u003cbr\\u003e\\\\\\\"Garden Vegetables\\\\\\\" were the typical Eggplant and zucchini that were grilled\\u003cbr\\u003eusing the same time honored techniques as used by traditional airline\\u003cbr\\u003estewardesses. And the crust tasted like Boboli. (I actually like Boboli crust so\\u003cbr\\u003eits not knocking Boboli...but I dont really want to pay 24 bucks for it.)\\\\n\\\\nThe\\u003cbr\\u003egirls got some other food that nobody could ever pronounce and they liked it at\\u003cbr\\u003ethe time. It seemed fancy and shiny and girls like that sort of thing. But\\u003cbr\\u003eafterward, when they got back to their rooms they were face-down in the toilet\\u003cbr\\u003efrom either food poisoning or they had become possessed by the monkey demon\\u003cbr\\u003eking.

Because they\\u003cbr\\u003edon't give you any. Which is O.K. since when the waiter actually DID come around\\u003cbr\\u003eto pour the warm water he would extend his arm across to reach for the glass,\\u003cbr\\u003ethus revealing the ripe smell of industrial armpits. I had to keep checking him\\u003cbr\\u003eto make sure his shirt wasn't melting onto the table.\\\\n\\\\nThe main waiter was\\u003cbr\\u003eprobably nice, but I wouldn't actually know that since not even a babelfish\\u003cbr\\u003ecould translate what he was saying. At least in the end he tried to stiff us on\\u003cbr\\u003ethe check which had a couple charges that we didn't make. \\\\n\\\\nNow that I think\\u003cbr\\u003eabout it, im pretty sure the reason why they use erroneous menu terms is so that\\u003cbr\\u003ethey can add it to the end bill and nobody would be the wiser.\\\\n\\\\nAll in all I\\u003cbr\\u003emanaged to only spend 40 bucks and still look like I wasn't the cheapest man on\\u003cbr\\u003eearth to the present company.

To me, this place should be a\\u003cbr\\u003eslam-dunk.  They offer fresh food and healthy alternatives to the normal\\u003cbr\\u003erestaurant fare.  However, there are a few things that really bother me about\\u003cbr\\u003ethis place.  Let me elaborate.\\\\n\\\\nThe first problem I've encountered is\\u003cbr\\u003einconsistency.  I like going to places where I know that I can order the same\\u003cbr\\u003ething more than once and get, well, the same thing.  Sometimes I get stuck in\\u003cbr\\u003eruts and return to places over and over for a particular menu item.  That's how\\u003cbr\\u003eI know whether a place is consistent or not... and this place isn't.  I have\\u003cbr\\u003eordered the same wrap (a BBQ chicken one) a dozen or so times.  Sometimes it\\u003cbr\\u003eabsolutely blows me away.  Sometimes it is flavorless and skimpy on the filling.\\u003cbr\\u003eSince I never know which way it is going to be prepared, I usually opt for other\\u003cbr\\u003efood places while I'm at The District.  The prices at Rachel's are similar to\\u003cbr\\u003ePanera, but at least I know how my Panera will taste.\\\\n\\\\nSecondly, the service\\u003cbr\\u003eis somewhat lacking.  At times, I've been greeted with a smile.  Other times, I\\u003cbr\\u003eam greeted with a huff.  It goes along with this consistency issue that seems to\\u003cbr\\u003ebe a theme at Rachel's - I like to know that I'm not going to be punished\\u003cbr\\u003ebecause the person taking my order is having a bad day.  \\\\n\\\\nLastly, some of the\\u003cbr\\u003etables are TINY.  Like, barely large enough for two people to comfortably fit\\u003cbr\\u003etheir orders on the tabletop.  Last time I visited, my fiance ordered a salad\\u003cbr\\u003eand I had a wrap.  Once you added drinks and utensils to the mix, it was a\\u003cbr\\u003ecramped mess.  Between the crowded tabletop and the fact that the table was\\u003cbr\\u003escooted waaaaay too close to the line of people waiting to order, I felt\\u003cbr\\u003eclaustrophobic and wanted to leave.\\\\n\\\\nWhen Rachel's is good, it's some of the\\u003cbr\\u003ebest food around.  When it's not, it feels like highway robbery.

My dad was interested in a glass of wine and the server\\u003cbr\\u003eoffered us a special that was half off the bottle so my dad decided to order\\u003cbr\\u003ethat since it was a great deal.  The food was delicious.  We had the spinach and\\u003cbr\\u003eartichoke with crawfish dip and the sampler as our appetizer.  They were sooo\\u003cbr\\u003egood!  Even the butter for the dinner rolls were to die for!!!  And as for our\\u003cbr\\u003eentrees, I wanted the prime rib but they were out so the server suggested the\\u003cbr\\u003erib eye steak and I am glad I ordered it because it was really yummy.\\\\n\\\\nWe were\\u003cbr\\u003ehaving a great time until the bill came and the server told us we could not\\u003cbr\\u003ecombine the coupons with the half off bottle deal so we thought that was okay so\\u003cbr\\u003ewe decided to just take the coupons.  Then the server came back again and said\\u003cbr\\u003ehe could only take one coupon and not two.  That was when we asked to see the\\u003cbr\\u003emanager because if the server had not told us in the first place that we could\\u003cbr\\u003euse both coupons or even suggested the half off bottle of wine, we would not\\u003cbr\\u003ehave ordered all that!  When the manager (his name is Scott) came, he just\\u003cbr\\u003epointed at the coupon's restrictions at the bottom and we totally understood\\u003cbr\\u003ethat (we only asked if we could use both in the first place because even though\\u003cbr\\u003ethe restrictions state that we cannot combine coupons in a single transaction,\\u003cbr\\u003esome places were able to take more than one in a transaction) but as a manager,\\u003cbr\\u003ewhat he did next was completely unprofessional.

The server came back out and the manager was\\u003cbr\\u003enever to be seen again.  Hm, figures.

You enter on the main floor, so if\\u003cbr\\u003eyou are there for EDM, stay there and no stairs. The main floor is the middle,\\u003cbr\\u003eso if you are there for hip-hop go downstairs, and now I can see a\\u003cbr\\u003eproblem.\\\\nSecond the non-VIP seating policy, there actually are places to sit\\u003cbr\\u003efor non-VIP. If you go downstairs, damn stairs!, you have two directions at the\\u003cbr\\u003ebottom, straight in the main room or do a 180 and walk down the hall. The back\\u003cbr\\u003eroom is open seating, at least until the promoters sell the seat as VIP, but to\\u003cbr\\u003eus it seamed like we had a place to sit all night. Plus those bartenders are way\\u003cbr\\u003eless busy and hoooook it up!\\\\nThird the nice staff, this one is true! These were\\u003cbr\\u003ewithout a doubt the nicest bouncers and bartenders we had ever dealt with, and\\u003cbr\\u003ewe have been to clubs from SF to Ibiza. It was a much better feel than the\\u003cbr\\u003enormal steroid-staredown that you get from most clubs in Vegas. \\\\nFourth the\\u003cbr\\u003edress code, this is normal for Vegas, smart casual. A previous post mentions\\u003cbr\\u003eflip-flops, I did not see any, but let's face it a dress code is 99.9% for the\\u003cbr\\u003eguys so maybe she did sneak in with them on...\\\\nFifth the music in the hip hop\\u003cbr\\u003eroom, the posts about the gangster rap are probably from people that did not\\u003cbr\\u003estay down there long enough, we really felt there was a good mix of many genres\\u003cbr\\u003eof hip hop, but we were there for Tiesto!\\\\nLast the dance floor, prior posts are\\u003cbr\\u003eaccurate, there is little to no dance floor for a club that holds 5000 people.\\u003cbr\\u003eThe main dance floors get so packed that it becomes more of a collective fist\\u003cbr\\u003epump rather than dancing. We found that upstairs was the better place to dance.\\u003cbr\\u003eThere is an open area up there, and while not technically a dance floor, we sure\\u003cbr\\u003eturned it into one! Oh and you can see the DJ booth from up there, if you look\\u003cbr\\u003ethrough the VIP's lining the rail. \\\\nThe lack of dance floor space is the reason\\u003cbr\\u003eI knocked a star off.

But then, get this, she did it again, when she\\u003cbr\\u003ecame back with my friend's drink and asked if we were ready to order, I ordered\\u003cbr\\u003emy drink, and then she turned to my friend, got her order, and then turned to\\u003cbr\\u003ewalk away. I stopped her this time, of course. Oh, and then later, she took my\\u003cbr\\u003eglass to get me a refill, and when she didn't come back for ten minutes, I\\u003cbr\\u003estarted looking around for her, and there she was, wandering around the\\u003cbr\\u003erestaurant with it, no idea which table it was from..

They were slightly too chewy for my\\u003cbr\\u003eliking and the sauce was very overpowering. As for the main dish, order the\\u003cbr\\u003epizza.

When we first walked by on a\\u003cbr\\u003eThursday night, it was packed. Not a single free table. The following day when\\u003cbr\\u003ewe rolled in around 5:00 PM, we were the only patrons inside. I wasn't even sure\\u003cbr\\u003eif they were open. It did start to fill up as we were leaving.\\\\n\\\\nThere are no\\u003cbr\\u003ealcoholic beverages available, but the complimentary tea is good. The menu is\\u003cbr\\u003equite small and it's obvious that they specialize in delicious dumplings stuffed\\u003cbr\\u003ewith all sorts of filling. Aside from the dumplings, they also have a few salad\\u003cbr\\u003eoptions. I was excited to try the cucumber and jellyfish salad, but our server\\u003cbr\\u003einformed us that they're out of cucumber. A nice lady offered to make a quick\\u003cbr\\u003eshopping trip to get more supplies. She came back shortly after and said that\\u003cbr\\u003ethe store was all out of cucumbers. Judging by our facial expressions, we were\\u003cbr\\u003eobviously disappointed. She offered to go to another market and try her luck\\u003cbr\\u003ethere only to return empty handed again. Sacr\\\\u00e9 blue!\\\\n\\\\nIt was official, my\\u003cbr\\u003egirl and I were victims of the great Montreal cucumber famine. Actually, right\\u003cbr\\u003eafter our meal, we hopped over to the first grocery store about 3 doors down and\\u003cbr\\u003efound an abundance of cucumbers for sale. I even remember the price ($1.30). All\\u003cbr\\u003ethey had to do was tell us that the jellyfish wasn't done marinating or\\u003cbr\\u003esomething along those lines. Lying to our faces about not being able to source\\u003cbr\\u003ethe key ingredient for a salad was just silly. Mise en place is an industry term\\u003cbr\\u003ethat these restaurateurs must learn.\\\\n\\\\nOn the sunny side, the main attraction\\u003cbr\\u003ewas phenomenal and our saving grace. We ordered steamed dumplings filled with\\u003cbr\\u003eshrimp, leek, and egg. The flavour was so delicate that I didn't want to\\u003cbr\\u003eoverpower these tasty little guys with too much sauce. We also ordered fried\\u003cbr\\u003edumplings with pork and mushrooms. These dumplings went great with their chili\\u003cbr\\u003eoil and a bit of soy sauce. Nothing beats fresh food that was prepared by cute\\u003cbr\\u003eladies who are masters of their craft. I really liked the one with her hat all\\u003cbr\\u003etwisted up Flavor Flav style.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, the food is fantastic, the price is\\u003cbr\\u003eright, and the WC is nothing like the monstrosities I've encountered in\\u003cbr\\u003eToronto's Chinatown.

I didn't think much\\u003cbr\\u003eof it when then management changed from Greystar to Birkshire.  Didn't see any\\u003cbr\\u003ehuge differences.

There\\u003cbr\\u003eare two zeros at the end of that number.  They charged me $1300 to clean a 700\\u003cbr\\u003esf. apartment.

I genuinely thought that Roosevelt Square was done\\u003cbr\\u003eruining my life.  I was wrong again.

However, we soon found that \\\\\\\"lower\\\\\\\" prices come with many\\u003cbr\\u003econsequences.  \\\\n\\\\nDrinks:  After 30 minutes of being seated, some were still\\u003cbr\\u003ewaiting for their beverages.

Don't the bartenders\\u003cbr\\u003eknow that Blue Moon is always traditionally served with an orange slice?  It's\\u003cbr\\u003elike serving a lime with a Corona.  Someone else ordered a martini.  It was\\u003cbr\\u003esloshed around as it was set down in front of him.  He had to wipe up the\\u003cbr\\u003espillage by himself.  \\\\n\\\\nBread:  Bread was served but it was cold (like it was\\u003cbr\\u003etaken out of a freezer and not fully thawed).  They asked to have the half-\\u003cbr\\u003efrozen bread taken away and replaced with \\\\\\\"warm\\\\\\\" bread at least twice; it\\u003cbr\\u003enever came during the entire two and a half hours we were there.  \\\\n\\\\nSalads:\\u003cbr\\u003eWe asked if we could get something besides a regular garden salad.  Our server\\u003cbr\\u003eadvised a Caesar salad or Wedge in its place.  We were never told that there was\\u003cbr\\u003ea significant upcharge to getting a slightly different salad.  $2.95 for the\\u003cbr\\u003eCaesar, $3.95 for the Wedge..the same cost if you ordered them separately.  When\\u003cbr\\u003ethis was brought to the attention of our server at the end of the meal, he\\u003cbr\\u003ebrushed it off.  I'm guessing it happens a lot at the restaurant.   The salads\\u003cbr\\u003earrived & we had to ask for silverware (for the 2nd time).  Several minutes\\u003cbr\\u003epassed and I finally got up and swiped them off an empty table.  Minutes after\\u003cbr\\u003ewe had started using the newly acquired silverware and eating our salads, the\\u003cbr\\u003eserver finally returned...with ONE set of silverware.  I guess we were supposed\\u003cbr\\u003eto share?\\\\n\\\\nEntrees:  Our entrees arrived halfway through the salads.  After\\u003cbr\\u003edelving into the entrees, several people had puzzled looks on their faces.  Some\\u003cbr\\u003ehad ordered their steaks medium rare or medium.  They came out with raw meat in\\u003cbr\\u003ethe middle.  And not just a small portion; it was golfball-sized.  Medium rare\\u003cbr\\u003emeans pink with some reddish tones; not raw.  Worse, one person ordered pork.\\u003cbr\\u003eIt, too, had a golfball-sized red raw center.  Trichinosis, anyone?  At this\\u003cbr\\u003epoint, we called over a manager.  When the raw pork was displayed to her, she\\u003cbr\\u003etried to tell us that it was \\\\\\\"fat.\\\\\\\"  Red fat?  In the middle of a pork cut?\\u003cbr\\u003eBeing served the raw pork is one thing.  Passing it off as acceptable by a\\u003cbr\\u003emanager is poor crisis management.  All of the undercooked meats were taken away\\u003cbr\\u003eto \\\\\\\"re-cook\\\\\\\" or replace.  The steaks were returned within a few minutes; the\\u003cbr\\u003epork wasn't.  With the plates that were taken away for the steaks were the side\\u003cbr\\u003eitems that everyone had ordered.  These were not returned on the plates and had\\u003cbr\\u003eto be \\\\\\\"re-ordered\\\\\\\" by us specifically requesting them from the server and\\u002for\\u003cbr\\u003emanager.   One friend ordered drawn butter with his salmon.  It didn't come\\u003cbr\\u003euntil he was halfway through the salmon, about 15 minutes later.  \\\\n\\\\nHalfway\\u003cbr\\u003ethrough my meal, I finished my glass of wine and ordered another glass.

After everyone finished\\u003cbr\\u003eeating and plates were cleared, the \\\\\\\"new\\\\\\\" pork finally arrived.  \\\\n\\\\nBill:\\u003cbr\\u003eDid I mention the Wedge salad that was on my bill after everything we went\\u003cbr\\u003ethrough and it was brought to the attention of the server that we were never\\u003cbr\\u003eadvised about the upcharge?  After all our problems, getting the bill with all\\u003cbr\\u003ethe additions was like a kick in the head after being punched in the stomach for\\u003cbr\\u003ea couple of hours.  \\\\n\\\\nSummary:  I'm just telling you the story from my side of\\u003cbr\\u003ethe table.  I don't even know everything that went on at the other side of the\\u003cbr\\u003e12-person table.  I only gathered stories here and there.  It wasn't just one\\u003cbr\\u003eerror.  It was one after another.  It wasn't just one person at the table.  It\\u003cbr\\u003ewas practically everyone who had a problem.  When the numerous errors were\\u003cbr\\u003ebrought to their attention, the errors were not handled in an appropriate manner\\u003cbr\\u003eby the waitstaff or the management team.  The biggest problem of the night was\\u003cbr\\u003ethat nobody seemed to care whether we had a poor experience or not.  The kicker\\u003cbr\\u003ewas that afterwards I wrote a 3-page letter to Mickey & Mooch corporate...and\\u003cbr\\u003egot no response.  They apparently didn't care either.

I can't say I enjoyed it one bit and almost\\u003cbr\\u003efelt like I was just eating it because it was so darn expensive!! ($17 with\\u003cbr\\u003ebeing a rewards member). The burger wasn't even that big and it just barely had\\u003cbr\\u003eany taste. The toppings were arugula and some sort of sauce, again nothing\\u003cbr\\u003ememorable. The Farm Burger had a nice piece of bacon on it, cheese, and an egg\\u003cbr\\u003e(doesn't sound original but in comparison to the Hog burger, it was decent). I\\u003cbr\\u003ereally don't feel like with the high price here for the burgers, these burgers\\u003cbr\\u003ewere worth the price. I hate to say it, but the burger was borderline dry. The\\u003cbr\\u003eMaui onion rings and garlic dipping sauce was tasty, but nothing that would\\u003cbr\\u003ebring me back to this restaurant just for that. The truffle fries were thick cut\\u003cbr\\u003efries and had an overwhelming truffle taste, almost to the point where you felt\\u003cbr\\u003egross eating such oily fries. \\\\n\\\\nI am glad I went and tried it and now my\\u003cbr\\u003ecuriosity is over and I will not be back.

The meatballs were flavorful, but dry, and the\\u003cbr\\u003epitiful amount of sauce supplied could not even begin to bring these things back\\u003cbr\\u003eto life.

I told him,\\u003cbr\\u003elettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, oil and herbs, which he repeated back to me to\\u003cbr\\u003econfirm.  The problem was when I got home the only one of the ingredients that\\u003cbr\\u003emade it to my sandwich was lettuce.....NO tomatoes, onions, pickles, oil or\\u003cbr\\u003eherbs.  I had places that made mistakes with my order, however not this bad, and\\u003cbr\\u003enot with me standing right there at the specific time telling him what to put on\\u003cbr\\u003ethe sandwich.

The atmosphere was charming and quaint.\\u003cbr\\u003eThe waitstaff was kind and willing to explain if there were any questions.  The\\u003cbr\\u003efood... was... boring.  Completely boring.  There was nothing resembling what i\\u003cbr\\u003ehave expected.  Being that I've eaten real french cousine cooked by a frence\\u003cbr\\u003echef, this was a let down.  At almost 300 for all of us... I would never, ever\\u003cbr\\u003ego there again.  Even the desert was lacking.  The wine was bland.  The entree\\u003cbr\\u003ewas overcooked and underwhelming.\\\\n\\\\nThey should consider hiring a chef who is\\u003cbr\\u003efamiliar with authentic french cousine, or change the name of the joint.\"],[\"We had a blast!

And of course no\\u003cbr\\u003eDrink place in Chinatown would be complete without offering Boba (extra 0.50) to\\u003cbr\\u003eany drink you please.  I usually order their Peach Tea if I'm not feeling the\\u003cbr\\u003eBoba or Regular Milk Tea when the Boba craving hits.  Another plus is that you\\u003cbr\\u003ecan order their drinks half sweet if you are feeling healthier or if you just\\u003cbr\\u003ecan't take the sweet\\\\n\\\\nAlso they have a stamp card! Buy ten get one free!\\\\n\\\\n2.\\u003cbr\\u003eDesserts\\\\nWho doesn't like shaved-ice fruit and condensed milk on a Hot Las\\u003cbr\\u003eVegas Day?? I haven't tried their shaved-ice yet, but once it starts to warm up\\u003cbr\\u003eagain I think I will.  Or if I'm feeling like a rebel in the winter\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n3. Real\\u003cbr\\u003eFood\\\\nMost Asian Drink places just have your usual Fried appetizers (which they\\u003cbr\\u003ehave here too), but this place also has full on meals.  Including sushi rolls\\u003cbr\\u003eand rice bowls.  So far I've tried their Fried Calamari App and Their Yami yami\\u003cbr\\u003eRoll which were pretty good considering it was from a Boba place.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n4.

I've stayed a couple\\u003cbr\\u003eof hours here (don't worry I also order food and a drink) and they have never\\u003cbr\\u003erushed me or made me give up a table\\\\n\\\\n5. K-pop in the background and on the\\u003cbr\\u003ewalls.  Now, I don't really listen to that music but it makes it is kind of fun\\u003cbr\\u003eto be around and makes the place not weirdly quite.\\\\n\\\\n6. Nice Staff\\\\nEveryone\\u003cbr\\u003ethat I've met that works here has a smile and is super sweet to me.  I feel like\\u003cbr\\u003ethey actually like working there and that they like each other which makes me\\u003cbr\\u003elike the place more too\\\\n\\\\nOverall:  Great place to get some work done, catch up\\u003cbr\\u003ewith friends, or grab a quick bite to eat.

So here is the good: we ordered one of their\\u003cbr\\u003eadult millkshakes (has alcohol) - the mint chocolate chip flavored one - which\\u003cbr\\u003ewas AWESOME. Mint and chocolate and so drinkable with mounds of chocolate\\u003cbr\\u003ewhipped cream and an oreo - what's not to like? It actually didn't taste like\\u003cbr\\u003ealcohol at all, which was good for me, but got us wondering what we were paying\\u003cbr\\u003efor.That came before all our food so I was kinda stuffed by the time I got my\\u003cbr\\u003eburger. My mom had the chicken burger on a wheat bun without additional toppings\\u003cbr\\u003eand my friend had the salmon burger with blue cheese on a sesame bun. Both said\\u003cbr\\u003ethat their meats were cooked really well. \\\\n\\\\nI was way waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay\\u003cbr\\u003eless impressed. I had the veggie burger since I'm vegetarian, which had an\\u003cbr\\u003eawesome description but was pretty effing bland. It was made of mushrooms, brown\\u003cbr\\u003eand white rice, lentils, caramelized onions, peas, and potatoes. It tasted just\\u003cbr\\u003efaintly of lentils and the mushy texture added nothing to the experience. I had\\u003cbr\\u003emine on ciabatta bread, which wasn't toasted enough to my liking so it was kinda\\u003cbr\\u003etoo soft. We also ordered sweet potato fries which were good, but nothing\\u003cbr\\u003especial. Same with the zucchini fries, which actually seemed like every generic\\u003cbr\\u003eburger joint zucchini sticks which you can buy in a freezer section. I was SUPER\\u003cbr\\u003eexcited about their deep-fried pickles, and sorely disappointed - they were\\u003cbr\\u003epickle spears, not chips, and the beer batter was crispy but way too heavy.\\u003cbr\\u003e\\\\n\\\\nI don't get why people think this place is so good - must be all the\\u003cbr\\u003etoppings.

The only reason why I stayed there was because a friend of\\u003cbr\\u003emine that lives in Vegas heard they had remodeled their rooms and wanted to\\u003cbr\\u003echeck it out.\\\\nWe checked in on Saturday, 11\\u002f12\\u002f2011 and they were nice enough\\u003cbr\\u003eto let us check in at 1:00.

Twenty minutes later, still\\u003cbr\\u003eno blow dryer or iron.  So we called again.  We were told they were on their\\u003cbr\\u003eway.  Another 20 minutes later and we called another time, this time to tell\\u003cbr\\u003ethem that we would just go down to pick it up.  Again, we were told someone was\\u003cbr\\u003eon their way.  Yet another 20 minutes later and still nothing.  We called one\\u003cbr\\u003emore time and again we were told they were almost there.  The guy finally got\\u003cbr\\u003ethere after another ten minutes of waiting.  We ended up waiting for over an\\u003cbr\\u003ehour just for a blow dryer and an iron.  Needless to say, my hair was already\\u003cbr\\u003edry by the time we got the blow dryer.  It was perplexing knowing that the Plaza\\u003cbr\\u003ehad 'remodeled' their rooms but the blow dryer or the iron didn't come standard\\u003cbr\\u003ein the room?  Even Motel 6 has blow dryers and irons in every room.\\\\nAnd then\\u003cbr\\u003ethere were some draining problems with the sink.  It drained REALLY REALLY slow.\\u003cbr\\u003eAnd granted, it was wrong but my friend threw up in the sink at 3:00am, making\\u003cbr\\u003eit worse.
