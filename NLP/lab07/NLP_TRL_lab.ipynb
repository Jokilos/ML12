        "+ After pre-training, our model can have trouble following instructions.  \n",

        "  However, the last approach can result in a model that generates thoughts that are hard to understand for humans and uses several languages (see [DeepSeek-R1-Zero](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12948)).  \n",
